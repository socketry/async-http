# Async::HTTP

An asynchronous client and server implementation of HTTP/1.0, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 including TLS. Support for streaming requests and responses. Built on top of [async] and [async-io]. [falcon] provides a rack-compatible server.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'async-http'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install async-http

## Usage

### Post JSON data

Here is an example showing how to post a data structure as JSON to a remote resource:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'json'
require 'async'
require 'async/http/internet'

data = {'life' => 42}

Async do
	# Make a new internet:
	internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
	
	# Prepare the request:
	headers = [['accept', 'application/json']]
	body = [JSON.dump(data)]
	
	# Issues a POST request:
	response = internet.post("https://httpbin.org/anything", headers, body)
	
	# Save the response body to a local file:
	pp JSON.parse(response.read)
ensure
	# The internet is closed for business:
	internet.close
end
```

Consider using [async-rest](https://github.com/socketry/async-rest) instead.

### Multiple Requests

To issue multiple requests concurrently, you should use a barrier, e.g.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'async'
require 'async/barrier'
require 'async/http/internet'

TOPICS = ["ruby", "python", "rust"]

Async do
	internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
	barrier = Async::Barrier.new
	
	# Spawn an asynchronous task for each topic:
	TOPICS.each do |topic|
		barrier.async do
			response = internet.get "https://www.google.com/search?q=#{topic}"
			puts "Found #{topic}: #{response.read.scan(topic).size} times."
		end
	end
	
	# Ensure we wait for all requests to complete before continuing:
	barrier.wait
ensure
	internet&.close
end
```

#### Limiting Requests

If you need to limit the number of simultaneous requests, use a semaphore.

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'async'
require 'async/barrier'
require 'async/semaphore'
require 'async/http/internet'

TOPICS = ["ruby", "python", "rust"]

Async do
	internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
	barrier = Async::Barrier.new
	semaphore = Async::Semaphore.new(2, parent: barrier)
	
	# Spawn an asynchronous task for each topic:
	TOPICS.each do |topic|
		semaphore.async do
			response = internet.get "https://www.google.com/search?q=#{topic}"
			puts "Found #{topic}: #{response.read.scan(topic).size} times."
		end
	end
	
	# Ensure we wait for all requests to complete before continuing:
	barrier.wait
ensure
	internet&.close
end
```

### Downloading a File

Here is an example showing how to download a file and save it to a local path:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'async'
require 'async/http/internet'

Async do
	# Make a new internet:
	internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
	
	# Issues a GET request to Google:
	response = internet.get("https://www.google.com/search?q=kittens")
	
	# Save the response body to a local file:
	response.save("/tmp/search.html")
ensure
	# The internet is closed for business:
	internet.close
end
```

### Basic Client/Server

Here is a basic example of a client/server running in the same reactor:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'async'
require 'async/http/server'
require 'async/http/client'
require 'async/http/endpoint'
require 'async/http/protocol/response'

endpoint = Async::HTTP::Endpoint.parse('http://127.0.0.1:9294')

app = lambda do |request|
	Protocol::HTTP::Response[200, {}, ["Hello World"]]
end

server = Async::HTTP::Server.new(app, endpoint)
client = Async::HTTP::Client.new(endpoint)
	
Async do |task|
	server_task = task.async do
		server.run
	end
	
	response = client.get("/")
	
	puts response.status
	puts response.read
	
	server_task.stop
end
```

### Advanced Verification

You can hook into SSL certificate verification to improve server verification.

```ruby
require 'async'
require 'async/http'

# These are generated from the certificate chain that the server presented.
trusted_fingerprints = {
	"dac9024f54d8f6df94935fb1732638ca6ad77c13" => true,
	"e6a3b45b062d509b3382282d196efe97d5956ccb" => true,
	"07d63f4c05a03f1c306f9941b8ebf57598719ea2" => true,
	"e8d994f44ff20dc78dbff4e59d7da93900572bbf" => true,
}

Async do
	endpoint = Async::HTTP::Endpoint.parse("https://www.codeotaku.com/index")
	
	# This is a quick hack/POC:
	ssl_context = endpoint.ssl_context
	
	ssl_context.verify_callback = proc do |verified, store_context|
		certificate = store_context.current_cert
		fingerprint = OpenSSL::Digest::SHA1.new(certificate.to_der).to_s
		
		if trusted_fingerprints.include? fingerprint
			true
		else
			Async.logger.warn("Untrusted Certificate Fingerprint"){fingerprint}
			false
		end
	end
	
	endpoint = endpoint.with(ssl_context: ssl_context)
	
	client = Async::HTTP::Client.new(endpoint)
	
	response = client.get(endpoint.path)
	
	pp response.status, response.headers.fields, response.read
end
```

### Timeouts

Here's a basic example with a timeout:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'async/http/internet'

Async do |task|
	internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.new
	
	# Request will timeout after 2 seconds
	task.with_timeout(2) do
		response = internet.get "https://httpbin.org/delay/10"
	end
rescue Async::TimeoutError
	puts "The request timed out"
ensure
	internet&.close
end
```

## Performance

On a 4-core 8-thread i7, running `wrk`, which uses 8 keep-alive connections:

```
$ wrk -c 8 -d 10 -t 8 http://127.0.0.1:9294/
Running 10s test @ http://127.0.0.1:9294/

  974480 requests in 10.10s, 60.41MB read
Requests/sec:  96485.00
Transfer/sec:      5.98MB
```

According to these results, the cost of handling connections is quite high, while general throughput seems pretty decent.

## Semantic Model

### Scheme

HTTP/1 has an implicit scheme determined by the kind of connection made to the server (either `http` or `https`), while HTTP/2 models this explicitly and the client indicates this in the request using the `:scheme` pseudo-header (typically `https`). To normalize this, `Async::HTTP::Client` and `Async::HTTP::Server` have a default scheme which is used if none is supplied.

### Version

HTTP/1 has an explicit version while HTTP/2 does not expose the version in any way.

### Reason

HTTP/1 responses contain a reason field which is largely irrelevant. HTTP/2 does not support this field.
