## v0.88.0

### Support custom protocols with options

{ruby Async::HTTP::Protocol} contains classes for specific protocols, e.g. {ruby Async::HTTP::Protocol::HTTP1} and {ruby Async::HTTP::Protocol::HTTP2}. It also contains classes for aggregating protocols, e.g. {ruby Async::HTTP::Protocol::HTTP} and {ruby Async::HTTP::Protocol::HTTPS}. They serve as factories for creating client and server instances.

These classes are now configurable with various options, which are passed as keyword arguments to the relevant connection classes. For example, to configure an HTTP/1.1 protocol without keep-alive:

``` ruby
protocol = Async::HTTP::Protocol::HTTP1.new(persistent: false, maximum_line_length: 32)
endpoint = Async::HTTP::Endpoint.parse("http://localhost:9292", protocol: protocol)
server = Async::HTTP::Server.for(endpoint) do |request|
	Protocol::HTTP::Response[200, {}, ["Hello, world"]]
end.run
```

Making a request to the server will now close the connection after the response is received:

    > curl -v http://localhost:9292
    * Host localhost:9292 was resolved.
    * IPv6: ::1
    * IPv4: 127.0.0.1
    *   Trying [::1]:9292...
    * Connected to localhost (::1) port 9292
    * using HTTP/1.x
    > GET / HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:9292
    > User-Agent: curl/8.12.1
    > Accept: */*
    > 
    * Request completely sent off
    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    < connection: close
    < content-length: 12
    < 
    * shutting down connection #0
    Hello, world

In addition, any line longer than 32 bytes will be rejected:

    curl -v http://localhost:9292/012345678901234567890123456789012
    * Host localhost:9292 was resolved.
    * IPv6: ::1
    * IPv4: 127.0.0.1
    *   Trying [::1]:9292...
    * Connected to localhost (::1) port 9292
    * using HTTP/1.x
    > GET /012345678901234567890123456789012 HTTP/1.1
    > Host: localhost:9292
    > User-Agent: curl/8.12.1
    > Accept: */*
    > 
    * Request completely sent off
    * Empty reply from server
    * shutting down connection #0
    curl: (52) Empty reply from server

## v0.87.0

### Unify HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 `CONNECT` semantics

HTTP/1 has a request line "target" which takes different forms depending on the kind of request. For `CONNECT` requests, the target is the authority (host and port) of the target server, e.g.

    CONNECT example.com:443 HTTP/1.1

In HTTP/2, the `CONNECT` method uses the `:authority` pseudo-header to specify the target, e.g.

``` http
[HEADERS FRAME]
:method: connect
:authority: example.com:443
```

In HTTP/1, the `Request#path` attribute was previously used to store the target, and this was incorrectly mapped to the `:path` pseudo-header in HTTP/2. This has been corrected, and the `Request#authority` attribute is now used to store the target for both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2, and mapped accordingly. Thus, to make a `CONNECT` request, you should set the `Request#authority` attribute, e.g.

``` ruby
response = client.connect(authority: "example.com:443")
```

For HTTP/1, the authority is mapped back to the request line target, and for HTTP/2, it is mapped to the `:authority` pseudo-header.

## v0.86.0

  - Add support for HTTP/2 `NO_RFC7540_PRIORITIES`. See <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9218.html> for more details.

## v0.84.0

  - Minor consistency fixes to `Async::HTTP::Internet` singleton methods.

## v0.82.0

  - `protocol-http1` introduces a line length limit for request line, response line, header lines and chunk length lines.

## v0.81.0

  - Expose `protocol` and `endpoint` as tags to `async-pool` for improved instrumentation.

## v0.77.0

  - Improved HTTP/1 connection handling.
  - The input stream is no longer closed when the output stream is closed.

## v0.76.0

  - `Async::HTTP::Body::Writable` is moved to `Protocol::HTTP::Body::Writable`.
  - Remove `Async::HTTP::Body::Delayed` with no replacement.
  - Remove `Async::HTTP::Body::Slowloris` with no replacement.

## v0.75.0

  - Better handling of HTTP/1 \<-\> HTTP/2 proxying, specifically upgrade/CONNECT requests.

## v0.74.0

### `Async::HTTP::Internet` accepts keyword arguments

`Async::HTTP::Internet` now accepts keyword arguments for making a request, e.g.

``` ruby
internet = Async::HTTP::Internet.instance

# This will let you override the authority (HTTP/1.1 host header, HTTP/2 :authority header):
internet.get("https://proxy.local", authority: "example.com")

# This will let you override the scheme:
internet.get("https://example.com", scheme: "http")
```

## v0.73.0

### Update support for `interim_response`

`Protocol::HTTP::Request` now supports an `interim_response` callback, which will be called with the interim response status and headers. This works on both the client and the server:

``` ruby
# Server side:
def call(request)
	if request.headers['expect'].include?('100-continue')
		request.send_interim_response(100)
	end
	
	# ...
end

# Client side:
body = Async::HTTP::Body::Writable.new

interim_repsonse = proc do |status, headers|
	if status == 100
		# Continue sending the body...
		body.write("Hello, world!")
		body.close
	end
end

Async::HTTP::Internet.instance.post("https://example.com", body, interim_response: interim_response) do |response|
	unless response.success?
		body.close
	end
end
```
